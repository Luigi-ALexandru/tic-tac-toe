# tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe is supposed to be made using factory functions / modules according to the TOP curriculum, however on the first try, since I find it
quite difficult to think in abstract terms and to convert what I want to create into objects, I decided to make Tic-tac-toe using procedural programming.

Now that I finished it (quite fast to be honest) I am going to refactor the code and turn it into factory functions. Hopefully I can make some progress and learn OOP and factory functions for good, which is the biggest obstacle in my way right now from making progress. 

Unless I've updated this README.md file, the code you have in here is completely procedural.
